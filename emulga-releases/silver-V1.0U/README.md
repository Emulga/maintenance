# These files are for restoring silver-v1.0U files and any patches released.

*That being said if you're on emulga-silver-V1.0U running the following command in SSH might be helpful*

_**(This is all one line so be careful with that copy & paste!):**_

`wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Emulga/maintenance/master/emulga-releases/silver-V1.0U/silver-install.sh" | bash`

_Please be aware this will restore Emulga customizations to your image even if you update RecalBox_

_**This is the only release where this command will be done after install, future versions will have this solution baked in.**_
